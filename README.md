 STAT184 Github Day 1 HW Template
Section 1 - In this assignment we used GitHub to use one of our existing R files to put it into GitHub.
Section 2 - I used the diamonds data set to create a scatterplot form Activity 9. I used the ggplot package to create a scatter plot that showed the carat vs price by the cut of the diamond.
Section 3 - We got plots that showed that as the cut increased the price also increased and as the carat value increased the price also increaded.
Section 4 - jsc5958@psu.edu
